## Getting Started React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Project

To run the project in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open your app in the browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page will reload when you make changes, and you may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- **`npm test`**: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It optimizes the build for the best performance.
- **`npm run eject`**: This is a one-way operation. It copies all configuration files and dependencies into your project, allowing you to customize them. You donâ€™t have to use eject unless you want more control over the configuration.
